## Purpose

The purpose of this notebook is to join the intermediate nutrient data into a single dataframe. 

## Set-up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r label = "read in packages"}
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(naniar)
library(here)
```

```{r label = "define data directory"}
data_dir <- "/capstone/kelpgeomod/google_drive_download"
```

## Read in data sets

data sets to read in
- Plumes and Blooms
- CalCOFI
- USGS
- LTER Bottle
- LTER Nitrate

```{r label = "Read in Data"}
# Read in data from tsosie

# Plumes and Blooms
PB <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "02-intermediate-data/09-nutrients-intermediate/unjoined/plumes-blooms.csv")) |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"))

# CalCOFI
calCOFI <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "02-intermediate-data/09-nutrients-intermediate/unjoined/calcofi.csv")) |> 
  # create nitrate_nitrite combined column 
  mutate("nitrate_nitrite" = nitrate + nitrite, .after = nitrite) |> 
  rename("ammonium" = "ammonia") |> # Natalie said the naming difference is likely do to how each data source quantified the measurement but it was okay to combine them. 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"))

# USGS
# Need to add source column 
# Also not an sf object but the geom column looks the same.
USGS <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "02-intermediate-data/09-nutrients-intermediate/unjoined/usgs.csv")) |> 
  mutate("source" = "USGS") |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"))

# LTER Nitrate
lter_nitrate <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "02-intermediate-data/09-nutrients-intermediate/unjoined/lter-nitrate.csv")) |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"))

# LTER bottle 
lter_bottle <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "02-intermediate-data/09-nutrients-intermediate/unjoined/lter-bottle.csv")) |> 
  mutate("source" = "lter_bottle") |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"))
```

```{r label = "combine"}
# Combine data sets
# Create list of data sets
data_set_list <- list(calCOFI, PB, USGS, lter_bottle, lter_nitrate)

# test with two that have different columns
joined_nutrients <- bind_rows(data_set_list) |> 
  replace_with_na(replace = list(nitrate = "NaN", 
                                 nitrite = "NaN", 
                                 nitrate_nitrite = "NaN", 
                                 phosphate = "NaN", 
                                 ammonium = "NaN", 
                                 temp = "NaN"))

```


```{r label = "write to csv"}
# write to csv
write_csv(joined_nutrients, "/capstone/kelpgeomod/google_drive_download/02-intermediate-data/09-nutrients-intermediate/joined/joined-nutrients.csv")
```
