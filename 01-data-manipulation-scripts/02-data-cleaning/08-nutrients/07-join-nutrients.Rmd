## Purpose

The purpose of this notebook is to join the intermediate nutrient data into a single dataframe. 

## Set-up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r label = "read in packages"}
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(naniar)
```

## Read in data sets

data sets to read in
- Plumes and Blooms
- CalCOFI
- USGS
- LTER Bottle
- LTER Nitrate

```{r label = "Read in Data"}
# Read in data from tsosie

# Plumes and Blooms
PB <- readRDS("/capstone/kelpgeomod/intermediate_data/Plumes_Blooms/Plumes_Blooms.RDS") 

# CalCOFI
calCOFI <- readRDS("/capstone/kelpgeomod/intermediate_data/calcofi/calcofi_nutrients.RDS") |> 
  # create nitrate_nitrite combined column 
  mutate("nitrate_nitrite" = nitrate + nitrite, .after = nitrite) |> 
  rename("ammonium" = "ammonia") # Natalie said the naming difference is likely do to how each data source quantified the measurement but it was okay to combine them. 

# USGS
# Need to add source column 
# Also not an sf object but the geom column looks the same.
USGS <- readRDS("/capstone/kelpgeomod/intermediate_data/usgs_nutrients/usgs_sp_data.rds") |> 
  mutate("source" = "USGS") |> 
  st_as_sf()

# LTER Nitrate
lter_nitrate <- readRDS("/capstone/kelpgeomod/intermediate_data/nitrate/lter_nitrate.RDS") |> 
  st_as_sf()

# LTER bottle 
lter_bottle <- readRDS("/capstone/kelpgeomod/intermediate_data/lter_bottle_nutrients/lter_bottle_new_coords_2014_2022_geom.RDS") |> 
  mutate("source" = "lter_bottle")
```

```{r label = "combine"}
# Combine data sets
# Create list of data sets
data_set_list <- list(calCOFI, PB, USGS, lter_bottle, lter_nitrate)

# test with two that have different columns
joined_nutrients <- bind_rows(data_set_list) |> 
  replace_with_na(replace = list(nitrate = "NaN", 
                                 nitrite = "NaN", 
                                 nitrate_nitrite = "NaN", 
                                 phosphate = "NaN", 
                                 ammonium = "NaN", 
                                 temp = "NaN"))

```


```{r label = "write to rds"}
# write to rds
write_rds(joined_nutrients, "/capstone/kelpgeomod/intermediate_data/joined_nutrients/joined_nutrients.RDS")
```
